## About Real Estate Machine Learning Model

I've begun my investigation on the fascinating discipline of Machine Learning by using the Melbourne Housing Market dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market).

Remember that you need access to Kaggle and download the CSV version of that dataset, in order to execute the Jupyter notebook!
